Simulation: Example stata code to implement estimators in the simulation is in "simulated_example.do"

Application: Code for the application is provided in "01_run_haltc_analysis.R". Because we cannot share the HALT-C data, we also provided a simulated dataset to run the code on in "01_run_illustrated_analysis.R".
